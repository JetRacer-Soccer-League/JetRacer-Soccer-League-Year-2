# JetRacer-Soccer-League-Year-2
Repository for UW Capstone 2023
The repo is meant as an overview of a DIY jetson nano project that involves assembly of RC cars, setup of the nano and running object detection and object following models to demonstrate the AI capabilities of the nano. This repo is intended as a starting point towards completing the intended JetRacer Soccer League Project that creats a 2v2 Soccer Game involving 4 jetson nano based JetRacers that could be manually or autonomously controlled.
