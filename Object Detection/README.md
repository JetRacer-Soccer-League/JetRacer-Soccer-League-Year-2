The YoloV7 object detection model can be trained and evaluated in the following [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mWgiQCeH25H3pVLu7JI98-XJGNznew_4?usp=sharing).

The weights trained on 5/23/2023 can be found here: [weights_5_24_2023.pt](./weights_5_24_2023.pt).

The github linked below can be used as a comprehensive guide to set up the yolov7 model on a 4GB Jetson Nano.
After following all the steps outlined above, the only step remaining to run inference is to transfer your custom trained weights into the proper directory on the Jetson Nano.
